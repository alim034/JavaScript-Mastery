/*
    Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
*/

/*
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces,
