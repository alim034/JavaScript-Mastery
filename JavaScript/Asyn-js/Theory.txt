1. Async (Asynchronous) = "Don't wait. Do other things while you wait."
2. Normally, JavaScript runs code line by line (synchronously).
3.But some things â€” like fetching data from the internet â€” take time 
4. If JavaScript waited for every slow task, your whole app would freeze.
So instead, JavaScript says:
"You go do your thing. I'll keep moving, and check back when you're ready."

Term | Simple Meaning
Callbacks | Functions that run after something finishes.
Promises | Objects that represent a future result (success or failure).
async/await | Cleaner way to write promises like normal code.
